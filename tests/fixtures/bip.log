01-04-2010 06:18:33 < TorroB!~torrob@192.168.0.1: i wonder how much power it eats
01-04-2010 06:19:29 < CamoF!~m@192.168.1.4: if its just a 5870 with 6 display port connectors, probably not too bad

01-04-2010 12:15:27 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: I'm starting to somewhat understand why new people are having issues with UV mapping... well, at least new people using blender. Been trying to help some guy (that's not really that new), and woow... UV mapping in blender seem horribly annoying.
01-04-2010 12:26:44 > Myself: haha
01-04-2010 12:40:31 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: hah.  
01-04-2010 12:40:44 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: "no it doesn't work... you have the source, fix it"
01-04-2010 12:40:50 > Myself: hahaha
01-04-2010 12:40:52 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: <grin>
01-04-2010 12:45:31 < woot!~47e0bd37@someclient1: heh the blender uv mapping? yeah blender is completely confusing ;)
01-04-2010 12:45:52 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: well, in this case it's not ONLY confusing, it's apparently also wrong.
01-04-2010 12:46:04 < woot!~47e0bd37@someclient1: lol
01-04-2010 12:46:06 < woot!~47e0bd37@someclient1: wrong how? ;)
01-04-2010 12:46:32 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: a cylindrical projection of a cylinder shouldn't result in any wrapping anywhere.
01-04-2010 12:46:45 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: and apparently it does.
01-04-2010 12:51:10 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: well, they also seem to like calling stuff completely different things from what everyone else calls it. 
01-04-2010 12:51:25 < rucksta!~rucksta@someclient3: which I guess might be part of the problem.
01-04-2010 12:59:35 < woot!~47e0bd37@someclient1: yeah that doesn't help
01-04-2010 12:59:42 < woot!~47e0bd37@someclient1: but i have used blender a LOT
01-04-2010 12:59:49 < woot!~47e0bd37@someclient1: and it has a lot of missing features

01-04-2010 14:54:10 < CamoF!~m@192.168.1.4: are you actually selling, or giving it away free?
01-04-2010 14:54:28 < AtWork!~c7f9b0fb@someclient1: giving it away....there's almost nothing to it at this point
01-04-2010 14:55:40 < AtWork!~c7f9b0fb@someclient1: i'll be submitting updates to it regularly though...the final vision should be a fun little multiplayer, turn-based, tactical, war game...with a twist?
